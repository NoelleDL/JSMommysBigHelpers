# Mommy's Big Helpers

A website that generates chores for my children.

## To Do...

Cleaning up my JavaScript! Will remove the jQuery as my goal is to do this using vanilla JavaScript and nothing else. 

```
As a user so that I know how to help my mom, I need to see what chores to do today.
```
```
As a user so that I know the temperature outside, I need to see the weather forecast.
```
```
As a user so that I know what is being served for lunch, I want to see the school menu.
```
```
As a user so that I know if I am at my mom's or dad's house, I want to see our family schedule.
```
